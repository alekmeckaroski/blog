## Introduction

Design patterns are used to solve problems that are repeating over time.  
They describe the solution to that problem in way that can be reused over time.

In general, one design pattern consists of 4 elements:

   1. **Pattern name** useful for referencing them in common language
   2. **Problem** describes *when* to use the design pattern
   3. **Solution** describes the *elements that make up the design, their relationships responsibilities and collaborations*
   4. **Consequences** are *results and trade-offs of using the pattern*. It is important to know whether you should use some design pattern for the particular problem.

Here I will use Java programming language for describing the design patterns.
